Thank you for your time!
I really enjoyed this challenge ðŸ˜€
As a friendly note, React is not my favorite front-end framework. 
I'm more of a Vue.js and Svelte guy. I like Quasar Framework.
I added tailwind as an external resource: https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation/play-cdn
I'm not a design expert but hopefully this looks a bit nicer now.
Also added Prettier with my preferred (clean) code style.
This OOP version is more OOP-centric with classes and constructors. Check them out on types.ts.
Also added a Debug component in the end, if we want help visualizing what's happening behind the scenes.

// Evaluation function - Whether our operation returns true or false.
// This whole logic could probably be a lot simpler if I took more time to refactor it.
function evaluateOperation(operation: Operation, args: Argument[]): boolean {
  // Used the nullish coalescing operator (??) a couple of times for alternatives / defaults.
  // It's especially useful here since we are dealing with booleans.
  // Added some optional chaining operators because there's a chance the args array might be empty.

  if (operation.operator === 'const') {
    return operation.value ?? true // Get the const value, otherwise assume true.
  } else if (operation.operator === 'arg') {

      args.find((arg) => arg.id === operation.argument)?.value ?? // Try to find the respective argument.

    // Definitely better than an eventual evil temptation of doing eval / Function.
    // In our case there's only max 2 operations in group, but this is generic enough to support more complex cases.
